<h3> In a language there are many ways to write a concept. Different person practices different ways to explain ideas. Some of them are easy to grasp, and some of them are so cryptic that we barely could get to the bottom of writers idea. To talk specifically onBengali language, we observe a significant distance between our speaking language and the one that were used before 1900. So the writings or literature is getting more or less unattainable for recent generation and the distance will be undoubtedly keep increasing as time passes. Our goal is to make this separation shortest as possible so that the literature would be more accessible to ordinary people. On the other hand language learners struggle a lot to cope up with a new language so this project will add a useful tool to aid them. </h3>
